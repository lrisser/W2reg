You will find in this directory the multi-class extention of the original W2reg code.

This multiclass extension has been extensively tested on masked NLP data so far (i.e. with function W2R_fit_NLP), but not non-masked data. Please use the classic versino if you treat non-masked data (eg tabular data, images, ...).
The multi-class extension for non-masked data should however be available in the following weeks, after validation.
